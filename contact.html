                    consult call via Zoom. You will then receive a confirmation of our appointment. 
                    In our call, we will discuss project requirements such as project 
                    goals and expectations, timeline, and budget.

                    At this stage, if you already have professional branding and colors picked for your site then I will begin 
                    designing your site plan. If not, I will put together a mood board and design template and send that to you 
                    to be reviewed.

                    Once you are satisfied with your site plan, I will send you a link to preview your unofficial site. If there are any 
                    changes you would like to make, you may have unlimited edits and revisions for one week. 
                    This week I will also link any third-party integrations and design your site layout for mobile devices.

        What to expect when we collaborate.\
        phase I \ planning
        1. Client inquiry

        The first step in bringing your vision to life is all about you! After submitting 
        an inquiry form along with answering a few short questions about your needs, I will
        review your information. 
        2. Consult call
        If I am confident that I can meet your requirements, then you will be emailed a copy
        of my appointment booking calendar so you can pick a day and time for our initial free
        consult call via Zoom. You will then receive a confirmation of our appointment.
        In our call, we will discuss project requirements such as project 
        goals and expectations, timeline, and budget.
         3. Contract and invoice 
        After our meeting, if we both agree to moving forward, you will receive a contract and
        invoice. After signing and paying, the fun begins!
        4. Project preparation
        You will be sent a document requesting any information or content 
        that I may need from you in order to start building. We will decide on a deadline for completing 
        your material so our project can start and finish on time.

        phase II  production
        5. Site Planning.
        At this stage, if you already have professional branding and colors picked for your site then I will begin
        designing your site plan. If not, I will put together a mood board and design template and send that to you 
        to be reviewed. 
        6. Designing. 
        Once you are satisfied with your site plan, I will send you a link to preview your unofficial site. If there are any 
        changes you would like to make, you may have unlimited edits and revisions for one week.
        This week I will also link any third-party integrations and design your site layout for mobile devices.

        phase III \ maintenance
        7. Maintaining your site.
        To end our project, I will host a 1-2 hour video call training tailored to your needs so you feel
        comfortable navigating your site or making minor edits. We will also discuss options for maintaining your site
        and how to request hourly work in the future. 
        
        phase IIII \ launch
        8. Make your site live.
        ongratulations! By now your brand new site will be made live and be accessible on the internet!
        After our project is complete, please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or to
        request hourly work!
